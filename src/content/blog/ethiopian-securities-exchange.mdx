Ethiopia has long been one of Africa's most paradoxical economies: the continent's
second-most populous nation, one of its fastest-growing economies for two decades,
and yet — until very recently — home to no functioning securities exchange at all.

That changed in 2024 with the launch of the **Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX)**.
For a country of 120 million people, the ESX represents more than a financial
milestone. It signals a structural shift in how Ethiopia thinks about private capital,
corporate governance, and its place in the broader African investment landscape.

## Why It Took So Long

Ethiopia's long absence from the capital markets map wasn't accidental. The country
operated under a developmental state model for decades, in which the government
directed investment flows through state-owned banks and enterprises rather than
through market mechanisms. Foreign investment in financial services was tightly
restricted. The Birr was managed under a fixed exchange rate regime that made
international capital flows complicated.

This wasn't necessarily mismanagement — Ethiopia's growth figures during the 2000s
and 2010s were among the strongest in the world, driven by state-led infrastructure
investment. But it meant that private companies had limited access to equity capital
and that ordinary Ethiopians had no formal mechanism for investing in their country's
growth.

## What the ESX Changes

The most immediate impact is on access to capital. For the many profitable Ethiopian
companies — including private banks, manufacturing firms, and agricultural businesses —
that have historically relied entirely on retained earnings and bank debt, a public
market creates a new funding channel.

It also changes the incentive structure around governance. Listed companies face
disclosure requirements, audit standards, and investor scrutiny that privately held
firms do not. Over time, this tends to improve management quality and financial
transparency — critical factors in attracting foreign institutional investment.

For the state, the ESX opens a path toward partial privatization of state-owned
enterprises. Whether that includes a company like Ethiopian Airlines is still an open
question, but the exchange's existence makes it structurally possible in a way it
wasn't before.

## The Challenges Ahead

New exchanges face a chicken-and-egg problem: investors want liquidity, which requires
many listed companies and active trading; companies want to list when there's an active
investor base. Building both sides simultaneously is hard.

The ESX also launches in a macroeconomic environment complicated by the Birr's
depreciation following exchange rate liberalization, lingering effects of the Tigray
conflict on business confidence, and the broader challenge of developing a local
investor culture in a country where most savings sit in banks.

Perhaps most importantly, the legal and regulatory infrastructure around securities
markets is still being built. The Capital Markets Authority, established to oversee
the ESX, is a young institution gaining its footing in real time.

## The Broader African Context

Ethiopia joins a growing group of African countries actively developing their capital
markets — Rwanda's exchange has become a regional model, Nigeria's is one of the
continent's largest, and Kenya's Nairobi Securities Exchange has long attracted
East African listings.

What makes the ESX particularly significant is Ethiopia's scale. A functioning,
liquid Ethiopian market could eventually become one of Africa's major exchanges
simply by virtue of the country's size and growth trajectory. It won't happen
immediately, but the infrastructure is now in place.

*The ESX is a central consideration in my honors thesis on valuing Ethiopian Airlines —
a state-owned enterprise for which any future capital markets activity would likely
flow through this exchange. You can read that research in the [Research](/research) section.*
